# Training the AI with Questions

To enhance Mavis's ability to respond accurately, incorporate questions into this plot. This practice helps Mavis learn and improve its responses to similar inquiries in future interactions.

**Ensure that the phrasing of your questions resembles what users might typically ask.**

### Examples

- "What is my MRR?"
- "Can you show the COMPANY_METRIC over time?"

## Training with the Dataset

We encourage integrating AI training into your data team's workflow. This approach fosters a habit of using AI training as a natural part of answering questions.

## When to Train

Mavis is already proficient at responding to a wide range of queries. However, consider adding training for:

**Complex Questions:**  
There are always challenges that are beyond the AI's current capabilities. By training with these complex questions, you help expand its understanding.

**Internal Metrics:**  
Mavis is not initially familiar with your custom metrics. Including the exact questions asked by users will allow Mavis to learn and respond appropriately when similar questions are posed in the future.

**Modifying AI Behavior:**  
If Mavis's responses are not aligning with your expectations, adding a tailored training question can help prioritize your preferred response style over its default programming.
