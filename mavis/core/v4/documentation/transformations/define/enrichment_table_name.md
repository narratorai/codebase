## What is enrichment in Narrator?

In Narrator, all activities are limited to just have 3 features.  This keeps the data model simple and clear.   But what happens when you want more than 3 features?

This is when enrichment comes in, it will allow you to add as many features as you want.

# FAQ


**What should I name it?**

By default we will call your table is an autogenerated name.  I highly recommend you make it more explanatory:

If your enriching `viewed_page` activity, then make the table `enriched_pages`.

If your enriching `completed_order` activity, then make the table `enriched_prders`.

**How do I use the columns from enrichment in Narrator?**

Enrichment columns behave just like features so you just add them in dataset in the same way you add any column.

In the background Narrator, will join the enrichment table (using `activity_id = enriched_activity_id`) when the column is used.
