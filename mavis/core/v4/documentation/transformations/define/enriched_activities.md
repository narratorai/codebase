# Enriched Activities

Enrichment is a simple way to add more freatures to an activity.

Once you create the enrichment table, you will be able to use any column in this table in dataset for all the activities you enrich.  In the background, Narrator will join the table to the Activity Stream using the appropriate key.


Please ensure that the `enriched_activity_id` is the same as the enrirched activity's `activity_id`.


*Note: The link between Enrichment Transformations and Enriched Activities can also be linked from the Activity pages.*
