## What is customer in Narrator?

In Narrator, all activities are linked to a `customer` that represents the person or entity that completed each action. The identifier that you choose to use for your `customer` will be used for all activities in Narrator. That's why we recommend using something like `email_address` to uniquely identify your customer across sources.

## What should I put here?

By default we will call your table `customer` but you can rename it to anything.
Consider making the name useful.

**You will be able to create an `Identifier` which will be the display name for your customer**
