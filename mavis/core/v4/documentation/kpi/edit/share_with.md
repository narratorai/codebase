# Tagging the KPI

Tags are like folders you can use to group your work.

Some great ways we have seen people leverage tags:

- Tag for each `team`: marketing, company, engineering, etc...
- Tag for each `initiative`: website growth, company Goals, Lead Conversions, etc..
- Tag for each `role`: data_engineering, data_analysts, marketing_analysts, etc..

# FAQ

**Are tags just for KPIs?**

No.  Tags are global and we will soon have them on Datasets and Narratives.

<br>

**How do I create a new tag?**

If you are a company admin then you can simply type a new tag and it will auto create.

If you are not then talk with your accounts admin to add it.


<br>

**How do I change the color of the tag?**

Renaming tags, updating their color and deleting tags all happen in the [Company Page]({company_url}/manage/company)


<br>

**Can I just give access to some team members to view some tags?**

Not right now, but we will soon release access control and it will allow you to do that.
