# FAQ

**How come I don't see my features analyzed?**

If your KPI is a total, you will not be able to run the analyze button.  This is because the analyze button is designed to recommend actions that lead to customer success, not to display non-action oriented metrics.  If you're just looking at totals, then the answer is simply to get more.  This is less actionable and we want to focus on recommendations that you can take actions on.
