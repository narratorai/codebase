# FAQ

**Is my KPI available to everyone?**

No, the KPI starts as `Private` and then can be shared via the edit page

<br>


**What should I call my KPI?**

I recommend being very explicit because your team will be seeing this metric out of context so instead of "Conversion Rate to Order", say something like "Email to Order Rate".


<br>

**This looks a lot like the Analyze button modal, is that on purpose?**

YES!  KPIs can be explored very easily and instanlty be used to generate full Narratives.
