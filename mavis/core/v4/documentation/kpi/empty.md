### FAQ

**What is the difference between KPIs and OKRs?**

OKRs (aka Objectives Key Results) are a common pattern in organizations to ensure that each department is doing that aligns with the global goal of the company.

Narrator's KPI feature is critical here.  We allow you to start with the companies overall goal, then test the "Key Results" that actually impact the goal. If it matters, you can make it a KPI and then repeat.

For example:

1. You start with **Total Order Revenue**
2. You can break that down to increase the **Visit to Order Rate**
3. You test things that can affect that KPI
4. You find that **starting a chat** impacts it
5. You create a new KPI to increase the **% of visitors who start a chat**
