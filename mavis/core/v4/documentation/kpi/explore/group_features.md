# Group Features

This is an easy way to create buckets to better analyze the features.

Narrator will automatically put everything you selected in `group values` in a bucket and call it `Grouped Name` (*Default: Variation*) and everything else in the `Else Name` (*Default: Control*)


Press `Re-Run` to update the plots.
