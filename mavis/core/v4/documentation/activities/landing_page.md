## Traditional Modeling vs Activity Schema
In traditional data modeling, SQL is used to create tables that have been prepared by cleaning and organizing the data, and performing metric calculations. These tables are designed to answer specific pre-defined questions, often related to reporting requirements.

On the other hand, an Activity Schema uses SQL to create activities. These activities are the result of cleaning and simple data preparation. They serve as the foundational elements that enable your team to efficiently carry out the final steps of data preparation and metric calculations. In Narrator, this is accomplished using the dataset tool.

The advantage of using an Activity Schema is that it empowers you to swiftly address an infinite number of data queries. In contrast, traditional modeling is limited to a fixed set of questions that can be answered.

This results in:

 - Faster answers to data questions
 - Simpler data lineage
 - Less maintenance
