# Welcome to your first transformations!
I noticed that you haven't added any transformations yet.


## What is it?
The Activity Stream is the single standardized source of truth for your customer behavior data and it is stored as a single table in your data warehouse.

The Activity Stream is a time series table with all of your customers' activities. As customers engage with your company (purchase products, call support, churn, visit the website), more activities are added to the Activity Stream. You can think of the Activity Stream as a timeline of all interactions that all customers have had with your company.

## The single table: `activity_stream` ( This is the default)

Each row represents an instance of an action (activity) that your customer has taken, with some details about that action.

## How it's used:

You can reassemble the Activity Stream to create any dataset you need. Narrator provides dataset tools to help generate those tables and export/schedule them so they can be stored and updated in your warehouse.
