<!-- Shows in the transformation name when you haven't saved the transformation yet-->

## What is the transformation name?

This is used to make it easier to navigate the transformations.

On first save, we will create a slug based on the transformation name and use that in the your table for the `_activity_source` column so we can look it up easier.

# FAQ

## It won't let me save?
The first time you save we create a slug and that slug needs to be UNIQUE in each table.
