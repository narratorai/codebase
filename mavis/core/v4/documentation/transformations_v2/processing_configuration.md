# FAQ

**Where do I change the way data is inserted?**

We call this the `Update Type`.  Look at the documentation to learn about all the different ways the data can be inserted.

**I changed the underlying data, What do I do?**

We call this a Re-sync (click `Trigger a Resync`) and this will delete all the data and reinsert it all.  (This is equivalent to pushing the data to production without making changes to the query)
