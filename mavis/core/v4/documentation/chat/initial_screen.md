## Start with a data question or fetching a customer journey

Mavis can do a lot but the best way to learn is to start going through questions.

- Once a data question is answered, try asking for recommendations
- Try asking to get examples from the plot
- Try fetching a customer journey then asking for Mavis to reply to an email
